Relational databases vs NoSQL databases

Relational db: The data tables used in a relational database store information about related objects. 
Each row holds a record with a unique identifier(key) and each column contains the attributes of the data. 
Each record assigns a value to each feature, making relationships between data points easy to identify.

Columnar: Column-oriented databases work on columns. Every column is treated separately. 
Values of single column databases are stored contiguously.

Document db: It stores and retrieves data as a key value pair but the value part is stored as a document. 
The document is stored in JSON or XML formats. The value is understood by the DB and can be queried.

Key-value: Data is stored in key/value pairs. It is designed in such a way to handle lots of data and heavy load.

Graph-based: A graph type database stores entities as well the relations amongst those entities. 
The entity is stored as a node with the relationship as edges. An edge gives a relationship between nodes. 
Every node and edge has a unique identifier.


In-memory databases vs. persistent

The main difference between a persistent and an in-memory database is where the data is stored. 
An in-memory database uses RAM as the storage. A persistent database uses some persistent storage media, 
typically a spinning disk (hard disk drive or HDD) or a solid state disk (SSD).
